# CS-3650-Computer-Architecture
This repository contains one assignment and a project I did with a group in my class CS 3650 - Computer Architecture
I took this course at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona

In the assignment, I created a few simple circuits. The assignement details can be found in the PDF file inside of the Assignment Folder.

In the project, we tried to create a processor that is able to do simple arithmatic. Assignment and Project both done using VHDL.

## Things I learned in this course
- Logic design and computer arithmetic
- Logical properties of flip-flops and sequential machines
- Pipelining
- Memory hierarchy and storage technology
- Multiprocessing and alternative architectures.
